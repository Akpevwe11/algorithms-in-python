## An Introduction to Algorithms and Data structures in Python

**Complexities of a linked list**

 - Access: 

 - Insert: When it comes to insertion in a linked list, there are three posibilities;

  - Insertion at the beginning of the linked list. 

  - Insertion at the end of the linked list (that is after the tail of the list).

  - Insertion at the middle of the list. 

 	

 - Search: to search any element in a linked list, the worst case senario will be O(n) because you'll have to raverse the li	st from the beginning till you can locate the element you're looking for.

 - Delete: to delete the first element in a linked list, just change the reference of the head pointer. 
 	
  - to delete the last element in the list, you'll have to traverse the list till you hit the none pointer, you then delete.	 deleting an element in the middle of the list is O(n).
